At the beginning of your program is a comment block that contains information about the program. Boxing the comments to make them stand out. The list that follows contains some of the sections that should be included at the beginning of your program. Not all programs will need all sections, so use only those that apply:

**Heading** 
The first comment should contain the name of the program. Also
include a short description of what the program does. You may have the
most amazing program, one that slices, dices, and solves all the world's
problems, but the program is useless if no one knows what it is.

**Author** 
You've gone to a lot of trouble to create this program. Take credit
for it. Also, anyone who has to modify the program can come to you for
information and help.

**Purpose** 
Why did you write this program? What does it do?

**Usage** 
In this section, give a short explanation of how to run the program.
In an ideal world, every program would come with a set of documents
describing howto use it. The world is not ideal. Oualline's law of
documentation states: 90% of the time the documentation is lost. Of the
remaining 10%, 9% of the time the revision of the documentation is
different from the revision of the program and therefore completely useless.
The 1% of the time you actually have documentation and the correct revision
of the documentation, the information will be written in Chinese. To avoid Oualline's law of documentation, put the documentation in the
program.

**References**
Creative copying is a legitimate form of programming (if you
don't break the copyright laws in the process). In the real world, you needn't
worry about how you get a working program, as long as you get it, but give
credit where credit is due. In this section, you should reference the original
author of any work you copied.

**File formats** 
List the files that your program reads or writes and a short
description of their formats.

**Restrictions** 
List any limits or restrictions that apply to the program, such
as "The data file must be correctly formatted" or "The program does not
check for input errors."

**Revision history** 
This section contains a list indicating who modified the
program, and when and what changes were made. Many computers have a
source control system (RCS and SCCS on UNIX; PCVS and MKS-RCS on
MS-DOS/Windows) that will keep track of this information for you.

**Error handling** 
If the program detects an error, describe what the program
does with it.

**Notes** 
Include special comments or other information that has not already
been covered
